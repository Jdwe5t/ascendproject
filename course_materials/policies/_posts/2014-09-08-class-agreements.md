### General Agreements:

* Sensitivity to strong smells
* Assume positive intent

* An occasional swear at inanimate objects is "okay"

* Let people know if you'd rather not be touched, e.g handshake, high five
* Willing to share expertise, knowledge, experience
* Be willing to say "I don't know"
* Failing is ALWAYS ok and is for learning
* You are _all_ good enough to be here
* Mindfulness of space and sound/movement during learning
* Ask for what _you_ need to learn best
* People use different words, look beyond jargon to what they are trying to communicate
* Pay attention when people are speaking
* Pause after introducing new processes
* Helpers check your learner(s) are keeping up/following
* Acknowledge requests for help, whether you can help or not (and it's OK to not be able to help)

* When you need help, don't give up
* Remember the "Power of Yet"
* Positive self-talk
* Take the judgement-free approach when teaching, meet people at their current level
* Helping is moving something forward or understanding where someone is at, if you can't help you do not need to step in
* If you need sound, keep it contained

### IRC/Digital Spaces Agreements:

* Ask before private messaging: "Can I PM you?"
* Be respectful of link posting - keep it on topic, respectful, remember trigger warnings
* Provide context for links before the link - what is it, is it safe for work or not?
* Bring your best self to this space - it's a public space, like your living room
* Female/feminine appearing nicks often receive more harassment. Something to be aware of. [Source (PDF link)]( http://cdm16064.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getfile/collection/p266901coll4/id/655/filename/617.pdf)
* To get someone's attention: type "ping [their_nick]". Wait for their response "pong [your_nick]", then talk.
* We'll use "shiny" as the highlight word for the whole group (make sure you set it in your client)
* Do not overuse the magic word (shiny)


### Paths of Escalation:

Sometimes an agreement might be compromised, missed, ignored, or broken.  When that happens we have made a group agreement to how we will deal with escalation:

* When possible, approach the person and ask permission to chat with them privately
* IF they agree to chat you can share your lens of the situation with them - no blaming or shaming - and let them decide how to approach that agreement in the future with your feedback now known

If someone declines a private chat request, check yourself to see what you need to feel resolved. When you still need to escalate the issue you can bring it to the cohort mentors and they will:

* Listen to your experience of the issue
* Work with you to decide what is needed for resolution
* Find a way to approach the person(s) involved without shame

Last resort for escalation is to bring the issue back to the larger group and check if the agreement needs to be rephrased or have a better definition/group understanding.

All of this is predicated on the fact that we created and agreed to these statements as a group and so we generally assume all in the room do their best to keep them in their intentions and behaviour.
