Agenda

9-9:30 am :  Breakfast

* Announcements
* When you lose work - NORMAL! (Because, technology)
* Pull requests: If you have one open, a new PR will tack on your latest commit, but not start a new one
* TOTD: In your non-testing profile (aka 'default') set your preferences to re-open last tabs
* Special Guest: Gregg Lind
* Kronda talks culture fit and hiring practices to watch out for
* Pair up & run another MozTrap suite (on Nightly)
** Still looking for everyone to file at least one bug, if possible

11:45 am: Head over to food trucks again for lunch

* Finding the 'blame' in git
* how to find things in a code base, not git (credits on SVN)
* Scavenger Hunt: Find when Lukas was added to the about:credits page
** Pair up
** hint: start at https://www.mozilla.org/credits/faq/
** Submit your answer (YYYY-MM-DD) to Lukas via IRC private message

When done:
* Catchup on anything, if you need to (check the catchup pad)
* Try searching Bugzilla for 'steps-wanted' bugs & seeing if you can find one to reproduce
* Start a blog post explaining (with screenshots) one of the following:
** How to set up & run MozTrap tests
** How to set up all 4 channels of Firefox to run them at the same time
** How to install the CrashMe addon and run it
** Another option of your choosing - the goal is to use screenshots and create a tutorial for another new contributor
